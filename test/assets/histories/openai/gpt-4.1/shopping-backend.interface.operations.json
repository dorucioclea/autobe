[{"specification":"This operation allows for advanced, paginated, and filtered listing of attachments (files/evidence) managed by the AI-powered shopping mall backend. It operates on the shopping_mall_ai_attachments table, which stores all file metadata, URIs, business domain tags, retention, legal, and access control information. Pagination, search by filename, uploader, business domain, retention policy, deletion, or legal hold flags, and ordering are supported. This enables administrators, auditors, sellers, and customers (each within their scope) to retrieve lists of attachments for products, evidence, reviews, compliance, and more.\n\nThis endpoint supports role-based filtering, permissions by attachment domain, and compliance flagging for audits. Sensitive files like evidence, compliance docs, and legal hold assets are only visible to authorized roles and are not returned for non-privileged queries. Attachment retrieval is critical for maintaining the backend's audit compliance, business integrity, and user transparency.\n\nRelated operations include retrieval of a specific attachment (GET /attachments/{attachmentId}), file upload (POST), update (PUT), and deletion (DELETE), each with distinct permission and business rules.","description":"Retrieve a paginated, filtered list of attachments uploaded to the shoppingMallAi platform.
