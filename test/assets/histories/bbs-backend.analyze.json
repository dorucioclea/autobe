Overview\nThis document serves as the foundational guide for the design, development, and deployment of a political and economic discussion board platform. The intent is to establish a dynamic, inclusive, and reliable space where users can engage in meaningful discussions, share insights on current affairs, and foster critical analysis of political and economic issues. The board aims to bridge diverse perspectives, enhance public discourse, and support knowledge-based community building.\n\n## 2. Motivation\nWith increasing polarization and the rapid evolution of information streams, the need for an organized and credible forum dedicated to political and economic dialogue has become urgent. Existing platforms are often fragmented, suffer from moderation issues, or lack the nuanced tools needed to drive informed debate. Our platform is designed to mitigate these challenges by encouraging respectful, data-driven discussions while providing safeguards to ensure civil and constructive engagement.\n\n## 3. High-Level Goals\n- Foster informed discussions among users of varying backgrounds\n- Provide reliable features for content creation, moderation, and engagement\n- Safeguard user experience with strong moderation, privacy, and accessibility standards\n- Support the discoverability and archiving of high-quality contributions\n\n## 4. Vision Statement\nTo become the leading digital platform for political and economic discourse by nurturing a respectful, accessible, and informed community where diverse opinions coexist, and robust debates drive social and intellectual progress.\n\n## 5. User Roles and Stakeholder Analysis\n- **Regular Members**: Authenticated users who can post, comment, vote, report content, personalize feeds, and participate in debates. Their primary goals involve expressing opinions, learning from others, and civic engagement.\n- **Moderators**: Trusted community volunteers or staff empowered to edit/delete posts, issue warnings, suspend accounts, curate trending topics, and manage escalated conflicts. Motivation: sustain quality, address abuse, and preserve community values.\n- **Administrators**: Platform owners and decision-makers responsible for system configuration, user management, analytics, legal compliance, and feature rollout. Expect a robust backend, flexible policies, and actionable insights.\n- **Guests**: Unauthenticated users with limited access to view public discussions, trending topics, and basic search features.

All interactive elements must supply ARIA labels and logical tab order so Alice can easily participate in discussions.*\n\n## 2. Security\n\n**Authentication & Authorization:**\n- Enforce strong password policies (min 12 chars, complexity requirements).\n- Offer 2FA by TOTP and backup codes for all accounts, especially moderators/admins.\n- Password reset process requires email verification and risk-based challenge questions.\n\n**Data Protection:**\n- All in-transit data encrypted via TLS 1.3+, with periodic review of certs.\n- PII stored at rest must be encrypted with monitored access logs.\n\n**Breach Protocol Example:**\n> *Upon suspected credential breach, all affected sessions are force-expired, users notified, and admins required to reset credentials. Audit logs facilitate forensic tracing.*\n\n## 3. Moderation & Abuse Prevention\n\n**Automated & Manual Controls:**\n- Real-time abuse filters flag suspected spam, slurs, or off-topic posts.\n- Escalation workflow for moderators to quickly review flagged content.\n- Role-based access restricts administrative actions, all with audit trailing.\n\n**Scenario:**\n> *If a heated debate escalates, multiple users report abusive messages. The system instantly hides these posts pending moderator review and notifies admins—ensuring community standards are safely maintained.*\n\n**Metric Target:**\n- 95% of abuse reports responded to within 1 hour.\n\n## 4. Performance & Scalability\n\n- P99 page load time <1.5s for up to 10,000 concurrent users.\n- System designed for horizontal scaling; supports 2x traffic spikes during major political events.\n- Rate limits (e.g., 10 posts/min per user) to ensure fair usage and prevent system overload.\n\n**Stress Scenario:**\n> *On election night, user traffic spikes 300%. Auto-scaling infrastructure adds resources, and all interaction remains within performance SLAs.*\n\n**Key Metric Table:**\n| Metric                | Target      |\n|----------------------|-------------|\n| Max Users Online     | 10,000+     |\n| P99 Load Time        | <1.5s       |\n| Abuse Response Time  | <1 hour     |\n\n## 5. Maintainability & Extensibility\n\n- Modular codebase allows roll-out of new features (e.g., polls, tagging) with minimal downtime.\n- All changes peer-reviewed via staging environments and automatic regression testing.\n- APIs documented for future mobile/native integrations.\n\n**Scenario:**\n> *A new emoji reaction feature is developed and rolled out in A/B tests. No downtime or existing feature regression is observed.*\n\n## 6. Compliance & Privacy\n\n- GDPR and local equivalents (e.g., Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act) upheld.\n- Consent dialogs for cookies, data export, and account removal built-in.\n- Annual external audit of privacy practices and access logs.\n\n**Scenario:**\n> *A user requests a copy of their data; the system generates export within 24h, confirming compliance.*\n\n## 7. Disaster Recovery & Backups\n\n- Full database and asset backup every 12 hours, incremental every 1 hour.\n- Geo-redundant offsite copies maintained, with quarterly restore drills.\n- Recovery point objective (RPO): 1 hour; Recovery time objective (RTO): 4 hours.\n\n## 8. Monitoring & Analytics\n\n- Central dashboards display real-time metrics: traffic levels, abuse trends, error rates.\n- 24/7 system alerting for outages and abuse surges.\n- Analytics track unique users, retention, and content/reporting patterns.\n\n## 9.
